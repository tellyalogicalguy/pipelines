To install python packages not installed on computecanada already, follow the instructions in the Python
computecanada wiki page.

When you install packages, they get cached and are visible to pip on the login
node, but don't seem to be visible on the compute nodes.
So, pip seems to try to connect to the internet, but does not seem to be able
to do it and spends a lot of time trying.

Saving the cached wheels locally and pointing to these wheels in the
pip install -r "requirements" file, makes it work much much faster.

To get the cached wheels, follow these steps:
1. create virtualenv and activate
2. update pip
3. install from requirements files (steps 1-3 done before as in Python
computecanda wiki)
4. Do:
pip wheel -r <<requirements_file.txt>> -wheel_dir <<local_wheel_dir>>
All the wheels in the requirements file will be saved in the <<local_wheel_dir>>

5. Update the requirements file pointing to these wheels instead and test
pip install using the new requirements file.
